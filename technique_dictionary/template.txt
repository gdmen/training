#### Summary:
Type: [[path:submission|submission]], [[path:shoulder-lock|shoulder-lock]]

Transition From: [[bottom guard|bottom-guard]], [[bottom half guard|bottom-half-guard]], [[triangle|triangle]]

Transition To: [[gogoplata|gogoplata]],  [[armbar|armbar]]

####Notes:

- In [[bottom half guard|bottom-half-guard]] the 'attacking side' is the side with the un-trapped leg.

#### Directions:

1. Attacking side hand underhooks and traps uke's same side arm. Opposite hand holds uke's same side wrist.
2. Opposite side foot on uke's hip, shrimp out to the attacking side such that torso is perpendicular to uke's torso.
3. While shrimping out, bend uke's arm at elbow such that his fingers are pointed towards his feet.
4. Attacking side foot over uke's arm (between uke's side and forearm).

    (If uke defends by holding onto this foot, transition to [[gogoplata|gogoplata]])

5. Use attacking side arm over uke's waist to start sitting up and prevent uke from rolling out.

    (If uke defends by rolling forward, transition to [[armbar|armbar]])

6. While sitting up, secure uke's forearm arm between attacking side thigh and torso.
7. Opposite side leg comes out and goes back (like a [[technical stand-up|technical stand-up]]).
8. Lean forward.
